# Geometry library

This library handles geometry operations.

To use:
```
from geometry import *
```

## Basic geometry operations

---
### d2vv(v1, v2)
*Calculate the squared distance between vector v1 and vector v2.*

**Synopsis:**
```
d2vv(v1, v2)
```

**Description:**

This subroutine:

  * calculate the squared distance between vactor v1 and vector v2.
  * is faster than dvv(), the distance calculation.   

---
### dvv(v1, v2)
*Calculate the distance between vector v1 and vector v2.*

**Synopsis:**
```
dvv(v1, v2)
```

**Description:**

This subroutine:

  * calculate the distance between vactor v1 and vector v2.
